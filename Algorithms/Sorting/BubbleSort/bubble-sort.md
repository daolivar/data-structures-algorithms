# Bubble Sort

Bubble sort is a simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly steps through a list of elements to be sorted. It works by comparing adjacent elements and swapping them if they are in the wrong order. This process is repeated until the entire list is sorted. Bubble sort gets its name from the way smaller elements "bubble" to the top of the list with each iteration.

The algorithm starts by comparing the first pair of elements in the list. If they are out of order, they are swapped. Then, it moves on to the next pair and continues this comparison and swapping process until it reaches the end of the list. At this point, the largest element has "bubbled" to the last position. The algorithm then repeats the process, but this time it stops one position before the last, as the largest element is already in its correct place. This process continues until the entire list is sorted.

The time complexity of bubble sort is O(n^2), where n is the number of elements in the list. This means that the algorithm takes a quadratic amount of time to sort the elements. In the worst-case scenario, when the list is in reverse order, bubble sort will require n-1 passes to sort the elements. In the best-case scenario, when the list is already sorted, bubble sort will only require one pass to confirm that the list is sorted.

Bubble sort is often considered one of the simplest sorting algorithms to understand and implement, but it is not efficient for large datasets. It is commonly used for educational purposes or for sorting small lists where efficiency is not a primary concern. Other more efficient sorting algorithms, such as quicksort or mergesort, are preferred for larger datasets as they have better time complexity. However, bubble sort can be useful in certain situations where the list is almost sorted, as it has the advantage of performing fewer swaps in such cases.
