# Insertion Sort

Insertion sort is a simple comparison-based sorting algorithm that efficiently sorts a list of elements in ascending or descending order. It works by dividing the list into two parts: a sorted section and an unsorted section. Initially, the sorted section contains only the first element of the list, and the rest of the elements are considered unsorted.

The algorithm iterates through the unsorted section one element at a time, comparing each element to the elements in the sorted section. It then finds the appropriate position for the current element within the sorted section and inserts it there, shifting other elements to make room. This process continues until all elements in the unsorted section have been processed, resulting in a fully sorted list.

To visualize the insertion sort algorithm, imagine sorting a deck of playing cards. You start with an empty hand (sorted section) and draw cards one by one from the pile (unsorted section). As you draw each card, you compare it to the cards in your hand, placing it in the correct position to maintain the ascending or descending order.

The algorithm's steps can be summarized as follows:

1. Iterate through the unsorted section of the list, starting from the second element.
2. Compare the current element to the elements in the sorted section, moving from right to left, until finding the correct position.
3. Shift all elements greater (or smaller) than the current element one position to the right (or left) to make room for the insertion.
4. Insert the current element into its correct position within the sorted section.
5. Repeat steps 2 to 4 until all elements in the unsorted section have been processed.

Insertion sort has an average and worst-case time complexity of O(n^2), where n represents the number of elements in the list. However, it performs well on small lists or partially sorted lists, making it a suitable choice in certain scenarios. It is an in-place sorting algorithm, meaning it does not require additional memory beyond the original list.

Although insertion sort may not be the most efficient algorithm for large datasets, its simplicity and ability to sort data as it is received in real-time make it a practical choice in certain situations.
