# Stack

A stack is a fundamental data structure in computer science that follows the Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) principle. It represents a collection of elements, where the last element added is the first one to be removed. Imagine a stack of plates, where you can only add or remove plates from the top.

A stack has two main operations:

1. Push: This operation adds an element to the top of the stack. The new element becomes the most recently added and will be the first to be removed. In other words, it pushes the element onto the stack.

2. Pop: This operation removes the top element from the stack. The element that was added just before the current top element becomes the new top element. It essentially "pops" the top element off the stack.

These two operations define the core behavior of a stack, but there are also some additional operations that are commonly supported:

3. Peek (or Top): This operation returns the value of the top element without removing it from the stack. It allows you to inspect the top element without modifying the stack.

4. IsEmpty: This operation checks whether the stack is empty or not. It returns a boolean value indicating whether there are any elements in the stack.

Stacks can be implemented using various data structures, such as arrays or linked lists. The choice of implementation depends on the specific requirements and constraints of the problem at hand.

Stacks find applications in a wide range of scenarios. Some common use cases include:

- Function call stack: Stacks are used by programming languages to manage function calls, keeping track of the order in which functions are called and returning to the previous function after a function call completes.

- Expression evaluation: Stacks can be utilized to evaluate arithmetic expressions by converting them from infix notation (e.g., 3 + 4) to postfix notation (e.g., 3 4 +), which can then be easily evaluated.

- Undo/Redo functionality: Stacks can be employed to implement undo/redo functionality in applications, allowing users to revert or repeat actions in a sequential manner.

- Backtracking algorithms: Stacks can facilitate backtracking algorithms by maintaining a history of states or choices made during the search process.

Overall, stacks provide a simple and efficient way to manage elements in a Last-In-First-Out manner, making them a valuable tool in many areas of computer science and programming.
