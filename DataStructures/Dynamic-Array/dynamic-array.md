# Dynamic Array

A dynamic array, also known as a resizable array or variable-size array, is a data structure that allows for the efficient storage and retrieval of a collection of elements. Unlike static arrays, which have a fixed size determined at compile time, dynamic arrays can grow or shrink in size during runtime to accommodate varying data requirements.

The key characteristic of a dynamic array is its ability to resize itself dynamically based on the needs of the program. Initially, a dynamic array is created with an initial capacity. As elements are added to the array, it dynamically adjusts its size by allocating more memory to accommodate the new elements. This resizing process typically involves creating a new, larger array and copying the existing elements to the new array.

Dynamic arrays provide several advantages. They allow for efficient random access to elements, similar to static arrays, as elements are stored in contiguous memory locations. Additionally, dynamic arrays provide flexibility in handling collections of varying sizes, eliminating the need to predict the exact number of elements in advance. This flexibility makes dynamic arrays suitable for scenarios where the size of the collection may change frequently or is not known beforehand.

However, dynamic arrays also have some considerations. The resizing operation incurs a computational cost, as it involves memory allocation, element copying, and deallocation. Therefore, careful management of resizing operations is necessary to maintain optimal performance. Additionally, dynamic arrays require manual memory management, including deallocating the memory when the array is no longer needed, to avoid memory leaks.

In summary, a dynamic array is a versatile data structure that provides flexibility in managing collections of elements whose size may change dynamically. It combines the efficient random access of static arrays with the ability to grow or shrink in size during runtime, making it a valuable tool for handling varying data requirements in programming.
